**Arcade Syntax Highlighter**
-------------------------
**This project is a VSCode syntax highlighter for the Arcade Expression Language**

-------------------------
[Arcade](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/) is an expression language that was developed by the [Environmental Systems Research Institute](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) (better known as ESRI). The language was developed to help GIS professionals who use a wide variety of ESRI products to complete various tasks with a simple and concise expression language.

The ultimate goal of this project is to increase the productivity of Arcade developers by providing a more stable way to write, maintain and save Arcade code externally. Additionally, it is hoped that Arcade developers will benefit by being able to write code in a more familiar code editor.
